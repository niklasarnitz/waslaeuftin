## 2025-02-17 - Added missing ARIA labels to search fields and icon buttons
**Learning:** Found multiple instances where search inputs (`<Input>`) lacked explicit `aria-label` attributes even though they had placeholder text. Additionally, icon-only utility buttons like the "Request Location" button only used `title` attributes, which are insufficient for robust screen reader support.
**Action:** Always verify that interactive icon-only buttons (`<button>`) and form inputs (`<input>`) contain an explicit `aria-label` attribute, regardless of placeholders or titles.
